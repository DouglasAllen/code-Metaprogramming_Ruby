    # Generally speaking, this should be thought of as a last resort when
    # you can't find any other way to specify the behaviour you wish to
    # specify.
    #
    # If you do find yourself in such a situation, you could always write
    # a custom matcher, which would likely make your specs more expressive.

    # == Examples
    #
    #   5.should satisfy { |n|
    #     n > 3
    #   }
    def satisfy(&block)
      Matchers::Satisfy.new(&block)
