# Hack to load json gem first so we can overwrite its to_json.

# The JSON gem adds a few modules to Ruby core classes containing :to_json definition, overwriting
# their default behavior. That said, we need to define the basic to_json method in all of them,
# otherwise they will always use to_json gem implementation, which is backwards incompatible in
# several cases (for instance, the JSON implementation for Hash does not work) with inheritance
# and consequently classes as ActiveSupport::OrderedHash cannot be serialized to json.

    # Dumps object in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). See www.json.org for more info.
    def to_json(options = nil)
      ActiveSupport::JSON.encode(self, options)
