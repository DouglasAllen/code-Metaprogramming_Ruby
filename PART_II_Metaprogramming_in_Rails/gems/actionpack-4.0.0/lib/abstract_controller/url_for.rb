module AbstractController
  # Includes +url_for+ into the host class (e.g. an abstract controller or mailer). The class
  # has to provide a +RouteSet+ by implementing the <tt>_routes</tt> methods. Otherwise, an
  # exception will be raised.
  #
  # Note that this module is completely decoupled from HTTP - the only requirement is a valid
  # <tt>_routes</tt> implementation.
