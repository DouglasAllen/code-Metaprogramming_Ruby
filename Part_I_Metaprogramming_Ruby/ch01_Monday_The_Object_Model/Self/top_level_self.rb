# top_level_self.rb
x = 1  
# you have created a top level local variable x. If you type:

def m  
end  
# you have created a top level method - an instance method of Object (even though self is not Object).
# Top-level methods are always private. Ruby provides you with a start-up self at the top level. If you type:

puts self
puts self.class
